Bootcamp Prework Study Guide for Students 2022
# <Prework-Study-Guide-2022>

## Description
My motivation for this project was to get a better understanding of coding and to learn something brand new. I built this project because I wanted get an indepth understanding of web development before class started. The problem the project solved was adding style to the website, functioning Javascript, and HTML for the website.I learned so much when making this project, I've always heard of Javascript and HTML but never knew the functions of both languages! Also, I had never heard of CSS. Before the prework, I thought photoshop or some form of photoshop was used to develop the styling of a webpage.
